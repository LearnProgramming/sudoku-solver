# sudoku-solver

This program treats a sudoku puzzle as a [set cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem)
and then solves it using Knuth's [dancing links algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links).

See [this blog article](https://gieseanw.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/solving-sudoku-revisited/) for an
in-depth explanation of the idea.
